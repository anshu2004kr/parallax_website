         <h2> Greenry with Sunlight. </h2>
          <p>
              Organizations consist of individuals and groups engaged in collective action to pursue common goals. As such, organizations require resources to survive and prosper.
              Organizational resources include people, energy, material, technology, knowledge, and capital [18]. Ironically, organizations have paid relatively little attention to
              natural elements and sunlight—two resources that are available to almost all organizations, that are free or relatively inexpensive, and that can provide physiological
              and psychological benefits to employees .
            </p>

           <p>
            One explanation for the link between natural elements exposure and improved mental health involves mechanisms that reduce mental fatigue. Natural elements have a restorative
             effect on mental fatigue [9, 27]. Attention-restoration theory suggests that the mind is like a muscle [28]. When the mind is engaged in directed attention—as would be the 
             case when it is exposed to built environments and after extended concentration on work tasks—it becomes fatigued and requires rest and recuperation to function effectively. 
             Exposure to nature involves indirect attention, characterized by fascination [29]. This has a restorative effect on
             the mind, countering fatigue—much like rest has on a fatigued muscle.

            <h2>  Importance of Tree.  </h2>
             <p>
                Since the beginning, trees have furnished us with two of life’s essentials, 
                food and oxygen. As we evolved, they provided additional necessities such as 
                shelter, medicine, and tools. Today, their value continues to increase and more
                 benefits of trees are being discovered as their role expands to satisfy the needs
                  created by our modern lifestyles.
               </p>
              <p>
                Trees are an important part of every community.
                 Our streets, parks, playgrounds and backyards 
                 are lined with trees that create a peaceful, aesthetically
                  pleasing environment. Trees increase our quality of life by
                   bringing natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban settings. 
                   We gather under the cool shade they provide during outdoor activities
                    with family and friends. Many neighborhoods are also the home of very 
                    old trees that serve as historic landmarks and a great source of town pride.

                Using trees in cities to deflect the sunlight reduces the heat island 
                effect caused by pavement and commercial buildings.

            <h2> Love with  Animal . </h2>
             <p>
                Finding and securing the perfect mate in the animal world brings out the best of 
                the male population. Many go to great competitive and creative lengths to win over 
                their future partner, but the females usually have the final say. After all, the
                 fundamental bonds they will share as a couple will have a direct impact on whether 
                 their offspring will survive and thrive. Yet the question persists, can we call
                  these bonds love? NATURE takes a provocative look at the love life of animals
                   in Love in the Animal Kingdom.
               </p>
   
             <p>
                The search for a mate takes many forms in the animal world. In the Arctic, 
                normally solitary polar bear males sometimes spend weeks using their excellent
                 sense of smell to track the scent of a female who will soon be ready to mate.
                  Introductions take the form of sniffing each other closely, as the
                   particulars of a bear’s age and health can be learned from its scent.
                    In the next step their courtship, the two will begin to play, which 
                    allows the female to test his fitness by seeing if he can follow her 
                    up and down steep slopes. Since she’ll be raising the cubs alone, it’s 
                    crucial for the female to choose a mate in top condition who will give
                     her strong and healthy offspring for her to rear. Once she decides he’s 
                     the one, she reels him in.
